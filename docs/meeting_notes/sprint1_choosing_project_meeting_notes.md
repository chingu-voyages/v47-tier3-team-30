### ACTION ITEMS
1.	**All 3 members** will have a look online to search for any public datasets for either @SOOS or @Zie projects. If we can’t find anything **by tomorrow Saturday 13 Jan. 2pm** then we text the group to inform and I guess we go with the carbon project. I.e maybe we find some fashion/shopping data to add to the carbon. That could also work. 2pm can be the deadline and then we can start thinking about the MVP and features we want to have.

2.	All members must prepare the following info to define our project:
Problem Statement: ........ (i. e Easy access, Curating and sharing of content for teachers) Product Vision/ Solution: ..................(i.e A social networking app that enables teachers to connect with each other, share, upload and repurpose content) Who: .........(i.e Teachers) Use Cases:....... (i.e Connect with other teachers Upload content, download content, share content Schedule Social Events Able to form Group)

3.	All members must **prepare at least 2-3 high-level Features** with description (only user-facing features)for our project
    1.	Identify & prioritize features
    2.	Create an epic for each feature
    3.	Choose the highest priority epics & divide them into user stories
    4.	Add your epics & user stories to the backlog tool you've chosen (ZenHub, Jira, Trello, etc.)
    5.	Prioritize the user stories
